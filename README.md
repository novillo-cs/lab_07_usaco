## Directions:

* Implement the solution for the bronze and silver problems. The following method must be implemented in files Bronze.java and Silver.java. Do NOT change change method signature, if you do, you will lose points. 
  
```public static long solve(String input_filename)```

* You may have helper methods.

* In the Driver you may test your solutions like this:

```
long  bronzeSol = Bronze.solve("YOUR_FILE_HERE");
System.out.println("Bronze solution: " + bronzeSol);
long silverSol = Silver.solve("YOUR_FILE_HERE");
System.out.println("Silver solution: " + silverSol);
```

* Test your code with the two test cases provided. If you would like you can craeate your own test cases.
  
* Check if your solution is the same as the one provided in the output files.

## Reminder:

Make sure your lab compiles before submit it. If it does not compile you will not receive any credit for the lab, you could resubmit a working version for partial credit (20% will be deducted).
